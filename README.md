### Because it sucks to develop on the large screen

**DEMO: http://stefek99.github.io/jQuery-Mobile-Desktop-Development-Template/ **

* Background: http://regivic.deviantart.com/art/iPhone-4-Blueprint-2560x1440-173475601
* JQM: http://jquerymobile.com/
* Yeoman: http://yeoman.io/ (HTML5 boilerplate)
* iPhone image: from somewhere
* back then I was relying on jQuery mobile, currently I use Ionic: http://www.iamthespecialist.com/2014/03/so-you-are-trying-to-find-web-framework.html (with much better results)

Note: ```python -m SimpleHTTPServer``` as serving via ```file://``` will cause an error:
> Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin "null" from accessing a frame with origin "null". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
